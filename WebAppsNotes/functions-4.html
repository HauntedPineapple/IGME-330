        /*Both functions and variables that are declared using either let or const, 
        are scoped to the current block they were declared in.

        A Block is delimited by a pair of curly braces {} and is used to group zero or more statements.

        Scope means where your variable is accessible and modifiable in your program.

        Functions and variables declared by let and const have as their scope 
        the block in which they are defined, as well as in any contained sub-blocks.

        If a variable is declared with let and const outside of a block 
        (at the top-level of the <script> element) it has script scope. 

        Script scope means that the variable is available throughout the current script, 
        and in other <script> tags.

        // #1 - a & b here are in "script scope" because they are declared outside of a block
        let A = "A";
        let B = "B";


        // #2 a function 
        function func1() {
            let A = "AA"; // A scoped to this function's block masks the "script scoped" A
            console.log(`INSIDE func1() A equals ${A}`); // "AA"
            console.log(`INSIDE func1() B equals ${B}`); // "B" - "script scoped" b is visible
            B = "BB"; // change value of "script scoped" B
            let C = "C"; // declare a block-scoped C variable
            debugger; // debugger breakpoint
        }

        func1(); // call func1()
        console.log(`OUTSIDE func1() A equals ${A}`); // "A" - A is in scope

        console.log(`OUTSIDE func1() B equals ${B}`); // "BB" -  B is in scope

        //console.log(`OUTSIDE func1() C equals ${C}`); // reference error! C is not defined

        debugger; // debugger breakpoint


        /*The "debugger;"" statement will suspend execution of the program and
        allow us to inspect both the value of the variables, and their scope.
        Note that we have 3 scopes here: "Local", "Script", and "Global".

        func1() has 2 "locally" scoped variables (i.e. to the function block) - A and C.
        A and B are "script" scoped and are thus visible throughout this page and other scripts of the page.
        There are 2 A variables here - one in script scope, the other in local scope. 
        The locally scoped A in func1() will "mask" the script scoped A within func1().
        There are many globally scoped objects - alerts, arrays, the Math object, and so on. 
        Functions that we create at the top level with the function keyword are also in the global scope.
        Our scripts have full access to these and other global variables.
        
        Try this: Remove the debugger; statements and uncomment the final console.log() 
        that tries to print out C. Of course it fails because we can't access local variables 
        from outside the block in which they were declared in.*/
